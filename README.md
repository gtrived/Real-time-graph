# Real-time-graph

While working with NVD3.js for data visualization , I was not able to find sample-use case with Angular 5 at that time (March 2019) and most codes available online were with Angular.js. 

### line-chart.component.ts :
Contains a sample use-case of using NVD3.js for real-time graph plots with Angular 5.
